## 🧠 Key Features

* 🔒 AI-based unauthorized access detection
* 📹 Facial/emotion monitoring and camera/mic surveillance (Premium/Elite only)
* 🧬 Data encryption and transfer over secure verified paths
* 🛑 Real-time lockdown on data tampering attempts
* 🐛 Worm-assisted attacker tracking (Elite/Military)
* 🗃️ Decoy generation to confuse forensic tools (Military only)
* 🔐 Authorized access system governed by the highest management purchasing the device, for sensitive data recovery
* 🌐 Offline AI decision engine with periodic updates
* 📤 Encrypted slow-path upload to organization-defined secure servers

## 🧱 Tier-Based Access Model

| Tier     | Users                     | Key Features                                                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal   | General Public            | Basic AI protection, encrypted uploads, user-defined sensitive data                                     |
| Premium  | Privacy Seekers           | Facial/emotion detection, live alerts, enhanced file-level encryption                                   |
| Elite    | Govt/Corporate Executives | IP tracing, forced lockdown, authorized unsealing by top-level device purchasers, persistent monitoring |
| Military | Defense Agencies          | Total control, AI customization, auto-wipe, forensic evasion via decoy data                             |

## 📂 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **AI:** Offline-trained ML models (anomaly detection, facial analysis)
* **Surveillance:** OS-integrated camera, mic, biometric APIs
* **Networking:** Secure socket, path validation, endpoint verification
* **Storage:** Secure local + cloud/hybrid (with binary data compression in Elite)

---

## 🧪 How It Works

* AI hooks into system calls, user activity, camera feed, and microphone.
* Sensitive file movement is monitored; unauthorized action triggers lockdown.
* Locked data is encrypted and uploaded only to approved servers.
* Biometric + camera-based dual authentication secures critical operations.
* In breach scenarios (Elite/Military), attacker IP is traced; decoys/worms are deployed.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔒 AI-based unauthorized access detection  
- 📹 Facial/emotion monitoring and camera/mic surveillance (Premium/Elite only)  
- 🧬 Data encryption and transfer over secure verified paths  
- 🛑 Real-time lockdown on data tampering attempts  
- 🐛 Worm-assisted attacker tracking (Elite/Military)  
- 🗃️ Decoy generation to confuse forensic tools (Military only)  
- 🔐 Judicial access system for sensitive data recovery  
- 🌐 Offline AI decision engine with periodic updates  
- 📤 Encrypted slow-path upload to organization-defined secure servers

## 🧱 Tier-Based Access Model

| Tier         | Users                    | Key Features                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Normal**   | General Public           | Basic AI protection, encrypted uploads, user-defined sensitive data                              |
2| **Premium**  | Privacy Seekers          | Adds facial auth, emergency locking, secure cloud uploads                                        |
| **Elite**    | Govt/Corporate Executives| IP tracing, forced lockdown, judicial unsealing, persistent monitoring, emergency auto-messaging |
| **Military** | Defense Agencies         | Total control, AI customization, auto-wipe, forensic evasion via decoy data                      |

## 📂 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **AI**: Offline-trained ML models (anomaly detection, facial analysis)  
- **Surveillance**: OS-integrated camera, mic, biometric APIs  
- **Networking**: Secure socket, path validation, endpoint verification  
- **Storage**: Secure local + cloud/hybrid (with binary data compression in Elite)

---

## 🧪 How It Works

- AI hooks into system calls, user activity, camera feed, and microphone.
- Sensitive file movement is monitored; unauthorized action triggers lockdown.
- Locked data is encrypted and uploaded only to approved servers.
- Biometric + camera-based dual authentication secures critical operations.
- In breach scenarios (Elite/Military), attacker IP is traced; decoys/worms are deployed.
